          enhance them.  It tries to fill the gap between the many
          excellent existing free raw converters and image management
          tools (such as ufraw or f-spot). The user interface is built
          around efficient caching of image metadata and mipmaps, all
          stored in a database. the user will always be able to
          interact, even if the full resolution image is not yet
          loaded.  All editing is fully non-destructive and only
          operates on cached image buffers for display. the full image
          is only converted during export. High-dynamic range, and standard
          image formats such as jpeg are also supported. The core operates
          completely on floating point values, so darktable can not
          only be used for photography but also for scientifically
          acquired images or output of renderers (high dynamic
